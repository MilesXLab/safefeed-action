## Coding Guidelines

### JavaScript/HTML/CSS Standards

**Code Style:**
```javascript
// ✅ Good
function searchBatchCode(code) {
  const trimmedCode = code.trim().toUpperCase();
  const results = batches.filter(b => b.code === trimmedCode);
  return results;
}

// ❌ Avoid
function search(c) {
  return batches.filter(b => b.code == c.trim())
}
```

**Comments:**
```javascript
// Explain WHY, not WHAT
// ✅ Good
// Filter out expired batches to show only current recalls
const activeRecalls = batches.filter(b => !b.isResolved);

// ❌ Bad
// Filter batches
const activeRecalls = batches.filter(b => !b.isResolved);
```

**Variable Names:**
```javascript
// ✅ Clear and descriptive
const batchCode = "123ABC456";
const isRecalled = true;
const officialSourceUrl = "https://...";

// ❌ Unclear
const bc = "123ABC456";
const ir = true;
const url = "https://...";
```

### CSS Guidelines

```css
/* Use semantic class names */
.batch-search-input { /* ✅ Good */ }
.input1 { /* ❌ Bad */ }

/* Group related properties */
.result-card {
  /* Layout */
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  gap: 1rem;

  /* Styling */
  background: white;
  border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;
  border-radius: 8px;
  
  /* Spacing */
  padding: 1.5rem;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
```

### Python Guidelines

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
"""Module docstring explaining purpose."""

import csv
from datetime import datetime

def process_batch(batch_code):
    """
    Process a single batch code.
    
    Args:
        batch_code (str): The batch code to process
        
    Returns:
        dict: Processed batch data
    """
    trimmed = batch_code.strip().upper()
    return {"code": trimmed, "timestamp": datetime.now()}
```

## Testing Your Changes

### Before Submitting PR

```bash
# 1. Test in Browser
# Open index.html and test your changes manually

# 2. Check Console
# Press F12, check for any JavaScript errors

# 3. Verify Data
python final_deployment_check.py
# Should show no errors

# 4. Test on Mobile
# Use Chrome DevTools Device Emulation
# Or test on actual mobile device if possible

# 5. Cross-Browser
# Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari
# Test on Windows, Mac, or Linux
```
